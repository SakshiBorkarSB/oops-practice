# Shape Area Class

This program demonstrates the concept of function overriding in Python using Object-Oriented Programming.

The Shape class acts as a base class with a common area() method.
The Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle classes inherit from Shape and override
the area() method to calculate their respective areas.

Features of this program include:

- Use of inheritance between base and derived classes
- Function overriding using the same method name
- Calculation of area for different shapes
- Demonstrates runtime polymorphism in Python
